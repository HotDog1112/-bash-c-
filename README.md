Implementation of grep and cat utilities in C language. 
Tests are executed by running a script through a makefile, target 'test'.

A separate folder with its own tests has been created for each utility. 
They work with unreadable characters, as well as with keychains (cat: -b, -e, -n, -s, -t, -v; grep: -e, -i, -v, -c, -l, -n, -h, -s, -o).

Code on the 'develop' branch.
